Study after study is confirming that your gut bacteria plays a significant role in your mood and emotions—happiness included. Some even call the gut a second brain.</p> <p>The gut produces more than 90% of the body’s serotonin, which is known as the happiness hormone. Also, 50% of the body’s dopamine, critical to motivation and focus, is made in the gut. Indeed, keeping your gut healthy is a way of keeping your emotions healthy. And it’s something you can do on your own in little time.</p> <p>In our 1-hour class, you'll hear about a very new idea: You can develop a healthy gut with your belly button! This is possible for a very simple reason: Your belly button is the center point of your gut and your entire body.</p> <p>Just below the surface of your belly button lies an extensive network of tissues, lymph nodes, muscles, organs, and, especially, nerves that link directly to the brain. By mindfully stimulating your belly button for just few minutes, you can unlock and unwind the tension holding these hostage and bring more blood, oxygen, and energy to your entire body—plus, more joy and happiness into your life.</p> <p>Come on over and learn a simple technique using your belly button that helps you keep your gut clean and healthy and your brain happy. Called Belly Button Healing, this innovative technique is something you can do regularly on your own to create a beneficial environment for your gut.</p> <p><br/>Similar to acupressure and abdominal massage and with a basis in Asian medicine, this holistic health method circulates blood, lymph, and energy and strengthens your gut. It also relaxes your muscles and joints, deepens breathing, and fosters a meditative state of mind.</p> <p>Belly Button Healing's detoxifying and other effects create a healthy environment for your abdominal organs and gut microbes to function at their best. It unlocks your second brain, reducing stress and empowering your body and mind to heal.</p> <p>In just a few minutes a day, or whenever you feel stressed or lethargic or want to recalibrate your mood, you can bring your body and brain back into balance with Belly Button Healing.  We are passionate to share this method, because we believe that it is a simple tool that can change your well-being in a big way.</p></div></li><li><h3>11) Círculo de Emprendedores: Validación de ideas de negocio</h3><h4>Address: Grow working (Carril de la Cordobesa 29, Málaga)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-01-30 19:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>En este círculo, dirigido por nuestro gerente Antonio Herrezuelo y el coach de emprendedores Martin Stellar, debatiremos sobre un punto crucial a la hora de decidir llevar a cabo un proyecto concreto: la <b>validación de la idea de negocio.</b></p> <p>Dedicar gran parte de tu tiempo y recursos a diseñar un producto o servicio sin tener indicios sólidos sobre si va a ser aceptado por tu cliente objetivo, es uno de los motivos más frecuentes de fracaso.

Location TBD based on interest - RSVP if you are thinking of coming.</p> <p>Mutation Testing with PITest - Unit testing has been a staple of code quality assurance since the widespread introduction of JUnit more than 15 years ago. Determining how well a code base is unit tested is a difficult and subjective endeavor. Code coverage tools like Cobertura and Emma measure what code gets executed by tests, but just because a line is executed doesn't mean that its behavior is fully tested. PITest (pitest.org) is a tool that makes some advances in better answering the question, "How well is this stuff tested?"</p> <p>In this presentation, we will cover some quick demonstrations of unit testing and conventional code coverage tools. We will then examine how PITest can help us ensure our code is better tested.</p></div></li><li><h3>8) Lightning Talks</h3><h4>Address: kohactive (800 W Huron St, Chicago)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-01-31 01:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>Hello all!

Study after study is confirming that your gut bacteria plays a significant role in your mood and emotions—happiness included. Some even call the gut a second brain.</p> <p>The gut produces more than 90% of the body’s serotonin, which is known as the happiness hormone. Also, 50% of the body’s dopamine, critical to motivation and focus, is made in the gut. Indeed, keeping your gut healthy is a way of keeping your emotions healthy. And it’s something you can do on your own in little time.</p> <p>In our 1-hour class, you'll hear about a very new idea: You can develop a healthy gut with your belly button! This is possible for a very simple reason: Your belly button is the center point of your gut and your entire body.</p> <p>Just below the surface of your belly button lies an extensive network of tissues, lymph nodes, muscles, organs, and, especially, nerves that link directly to the brain. By mindfully stimulating your belly button for just few minutes, you can unlock and unwind the tension holding these hostage and bring more blood, oxygen, and energy to your entire body—plus, more joy and happiness into your life.</p> <p>Come on over and learn a simple technique using your belly button that helps you keep your gut clean and healthy and your brain happy. Called Belly Button Healing, this innovative technique is something you can do regularly on your own to create a beneficial environment for your gut.</p> <p><br/>Similar to acupressure and abdominal massage and with a basis in Asian medicine, this holistic health method circulates blood, lymph, and energy and strengthens your gut. It also relaxes your muscles and joints, deepens breathing, and fosters a meditative state of mind.</p> <p>Belly Button Healing's detoxifying and other effects create a healthy environment for your abdominal organs and gut microbes to function at their best. It unlocks your second brain, reducing stress and empowering your body and mind to heal.</p> <p>In just a few minutes a day, or whenever you feel stressed or lethargic or want to recalibrate your mood, you can bring your body and brain back into balance with Belly Button Healing.  We are passionate to share this method, because we believe that it is a simple tool that can change your well-being in a big way.</p></div></li><li><h3>20) Neo4j and the Panama papers</h3><h4>Address: NCIM (Overgoo 11, Leidschendam)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-01-31 01:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p><b>Program</b>: </p> <p>18:00 Doors open - Dinner-Buffet </p> <p>19:00 We start </p> <p>21:00 We end the session</p> <p>

How data is handled today is much different than the classical mathematical approach of using models to fit the data. Today, people are supposed to find rules and properties within the data set and sometimes among different data sets.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explain data science and its relationship to BigData, cloud computing, and data mining. We also discuss current research problems in data science and provide concerns related to the data science industry. This talk will connect and group computer science, mathematics, information technology, social science, and other applications in order to give a comprehensive view of the future of data science. Emphasizing the bridge between computer science and math, we will explain why data science would serve as a tremendous engine to the development of the new computing and math theories.</p> <p>Data science is about the study of: (1) The science of data, (2) Knowledge extraction from massive data sets (BigData) mainly using machine learning, (3) Data and data set relations, (4) BigData processing including tools such as Hadoop and Spark on cloud computing, and (5) Visualization of massive data and human–computer interaction.</p> <p>In this talk, we give an overview of data mining and machine learning methods such as kNN, k-means, SVM, decision trees, PCA, and other popular methods. We also introduce timely problems for study including: smart search (also called the matrix completion problem or the Netflix problem), the subspace problem, financial data recovery, video tracking, and persistent data processing.</p> <p>For future research problems, we would like to discuss computing and algorithm design based on various MapReduce-based models. For applications, we provide a simple case study in image segmentation using MapReduce with detailed algorithm analysis.</p> <p>Dr. Li Chen is currently an Associate Professor of computer science at the University of the District of Columbia. He received his BS, MS, and PhD in CS from Wuhan University (1982), Utah State University (1995), and the University of Bedfordshire (2001), respectively.   Chen has worked in both academia and industry. He was a lecturer at South East University and Wuhan University in China before serving as a visiting assistant professor at the University of North Dakota, visiting associate professor at the University of Maryland, and adjunct professor at Virginia Tech. In industry, he worked for companies as a senior software engineer.</p> <p>Chen has given professional talks on various topics in many universities and colleges including the University of Toronto, University of Maryland, George Mason University, Rutgers University, NIH, and Georgetown University.  He was a visitor of DIMACS (Rutgers-Princeton) and a Scientific Researcher in the Fields Institute at the University of Toronto.</p> <p>Chen is an ACM Distinguished Speaker .</p> <p><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>If you would like to present at a future Meetup, contact Sarah at [masked]. </p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>6:30 pm - 7:00 pm - Pizza &amp; Drinks  </p> <p>7:00 pm - Presentations begin</p></div></li><li><h3>30) Workshop: Introduction to HTML and CSS (1.30)</h3><h4>Address: Disable address</h4><h4>Date: 2017-01-31 01:30:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learn-to-code-seattle-workshop-introduction-to-html-css-130-tickets-30540912692?aff=LTC"><b>IMPORTANT: RSVP to this workshop via Eventbrite.</b></a></p> <p>Want to learn how to code but never knew how to get started?

Reactive programming with tools like RxSwift isn't as simple as using a new utility, but a total paradigm shift for how you think about programming in the first place. As the tooling improves, I think a good majority of programming should be done in reactive style in the future.</p> <p>There is a fairly steep learning curve in learning "how" to do reactive (rx) programming, so we will start with the "why" and a little bit of "what".</p> <p>We will attempt to provide some level of refreshments, but please eat dinner beforehand.</p> <p>If you are interested in attending this or other iOS tech talks, please take one minute and fill out this form: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/u9tc8ii25XlD3n4i1"><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/u9tc8ii25XlD3n4i1" class="linkified">https://goo.gl/forms/u9tc8ii25XlD3n4i1</a></a></p> <p>This is our first time at Carlson Cowork so we may need to iron out some of the logistics.

A diferencia de librerías y frameworks como Hibernate, Slick no es un ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), es un FRM (Functional Relational Mapping). Toda su implementación está basada en la programación funcional y a diferencia de los ORM, no nos oculta la base de datos tras una capa ORM, si no que nos da control completo sobre nuestra base de datos y las operaciones que se realizan sobre ella. Además todas las operaciones que se realizan son asíncronas, lo que hace de Slick un librería perfecta para las aplicaciones reactivas.</p> <p>Veremos como Slick pone a disposición del programador toda la base de datos como colecciones (Collections) de Scala, y las ventajas asociadas a la hora de manejar estas colecciones desde un enfoque funcional.</p> <p>La charla será dada por <b>Jesús Martínez-B. (</b><a href="https://twitter.com/JesusMtnezBH">@JesusMtnezBH</a><b>)</b>, programador de Scala actualmente trabajando en StratioBD.</p> <p>-- </p> <p>El espacio para la charla será en <b>Liferay </b>(Paseo Castellana 280, 1º planta) a las 19:00. </p> <p>Esta cerca de la parada de metro Begoña, línea 10.

Developers writing bots all face the same problems: bots require basic I/O; they must have language and dialog skills; and they must connect to users – preferably in any conversation experience and language the user chooses. </p> <p>In this session, you will learn how to build and connect intelligent bots to interact with your users naturally wherever they are, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services. We will explore the Microsoft Bot Framework, which provides just what you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking. </p> <p>Through live demos, we'll cover the Bot Connector in the cloud, the Bot Build SDK with C# (Node.js is also supported) and well also explore how to handle natural language input from the user with the Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) from Microsoft Cognitive Services. Every business needs bots to provide a more personal experience to its users and customers. Come learn how you can build bots for your customers in just a few hours.</p> <p>Our speaker for tonight is <b>Ian Philpot</b>. Ian is a Software Engineer and Technology Evangelist with over fifteen years of experience in both development and systems engineering. At Microsoft, where he is currently employed, his focus is Azure Development. In addition to his work at Microsoft, Ian fills the role of Technology Advisor for Atlanta Tech Village, and FlatironCity which enables him to assist Startups and Entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Ian is an adept software developer and technologist. He’s worked on Emmy award winning projects and with customers around the globe. Cloud technologies are his focus and passion. </p> <p><br/>When he’s not behind a computer, Ian’s pleasure in the outdoors becomes quite evident.

<b>Kamil Szymański</b> - software developer, entuzjasta JVM i open-source</p> <p><br/><b>Architecting your codebase</b></p> <p>Legenda ludowa głosi, że większość dużych system kończy jako implementacja antywzorca big ball of mud i że uratować przed tym może nas tylko nowa, lepsza architektura. Oczywiście co roku nowsza i jeszcze lepsza, a mimo to nie zmieniająca w znaczący sposób tempa biodegradacji kodu wytwarzanych systemów.</p> <p>Wydaje się, że w pogoni za buzzwordami, seksownymi i rozwiązującymi wszystkie problemy technologiami zapomnieliśmy o podstawach projektowania systemów, bez których każda nowa architektura wiedzie nas w tym samym kierunku.Jeśli widziałeś kiedyś duży system, który mimo lat developmentu nadal można było rozwijać w racjonalnym tempie to był to zapewne system zbudowany na wspomnianych, solidnych podstawach.</p> <p>Dlatego też w ramach sesji live-coding spojrzymy na tak oklepane, aczkolwiek istotne, zasady i pryncypia jak enkapsulacja, SRP, modularyzacja czy high cohesion, loose coupling.Spojrzymy na nie jednak na nieco wyższym poziomie niż zwykła to robić literatura branżowa. Weźmiemy na warsztat projekt Spring pet-clinic, rozłożymy go na części (a raczej moduły) pierwsze i wykonamy jego refaktoryzację ku głębszemu zrozumieniu.</p> <p>


<b>Piotr Pracuch</b> -  technology enthusiast, humble dev @ Sensinum</p> <p><b>High-speed reactive microservices with Vert.x and rxJava</b></p> <p><br/>Rise of the IoT, mobile apps and increased interest in big data are changing the development landscape as we know it. Businesses are more and more reliant on the technology which puts an increasing pressure on availability, responsiveness and scalability. Traditional thread per request approach found in Servlet spec is unable to address new requirements efficiently, new tools are needed.</p> <p>During the session we’ll explore how Vert.x - unopinionated toolkit for building reactive applications - can help us address these challenges. We’ll review core concepts and principles and see how Vert.x can play nice with Rx. In the end we’ll put it all together to see a working service.</p></div></li><li><h3>12) NodeSchool Düsseldorf #1</h3><h4>Address: InVision AG (Speditionsstr. 5, Düsseldorf)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 01:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>We want to keep NodeSchool Düsseldorf as universal as possible, which is why we'll try and provide help in both German and English.

Als Workshopper werden <a href="https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode">learnyounode</a> und <a href="https://www.github.com/sethvincent/javascripting">javascripting </a>durchgenommen.</p> <p>Die Schedule sieht ungefähr so aus:</p> <p><b>18:00 </b>- Essen, Trinken und Javascripten</p> <p><b>18:30 </b>-Setup</p> <p><b>19:30</b> - Start des Workshops</p> <p><b>21:30 </b>- Ausklang bis 22:00</p> <p>Für Drinks &amp; Snacks ist gesorgt. <b>Bitte bringt eure eigenen Laptops mit, denn sonst lohnt sich das ganze nicht so!</b></p> <p>Als Gastmentor haben wir dieses mal die fabelhafte <b><a href="http://github.com/addaleax">Anna Henningsen</a></b>, die selbst zum Node.js-Core beiträgt und wahrscheinlich mehr über Node weiß als wir beide zusammen.</p> <p>Zur Anreise: Unsere Location liegt direkt neben der Haltestelle Speditionstraße, die man direkt mit der 707er Straßenbahn erreichen kann. Oder man geht 5 Minuten von der Haltestelle Franziusstraße, die auch von der 706er befahren wird. Wenn man mit dem Auto kommt, gibt es neben dem Gebäude auch kostenpflichtige Parkplätze.</p> <p>---</p> <p>At this first Meetup, we'll be learning about the basics of JavaScript and Node.js. The Workshoppers we'll work with are <a href="https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode">learnyounode</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/sethvincent/javascripting">javascripting</a>.</p> <p>The schedule will look something like this:</p> <p><b>18:00 (6pm): </b>Food, drinks and Javascript.</p> <p><b>18:30 (6.30pm):</b> Setup</p> <p><b>19:30 (7.30pm): </b>Start of the workshop</p> <p><b>21:30 (9.30pm): </b>Conclusion until roughly 22:00 (10pm)</p> <p>Drinks &amp; Snacks will be provided. <b>Please bring your own laptops, otherwise the whole thing won't really be worth it!</b></p> <p>For this meetup, we're honored to have the amazing <b><a href="https://github.com/addaleax">Anna Henningsen</a></b> as our guest mentor. She's a Node.js core contributor and probably knows more about it than both of us combined.</p> <p><br/>As to actually getting to the location: If you want to take the public transport system, the venue lies right next to the tram station 'Speditionstraße', which you can reach by taking the 707 train line. If you want to walk 5 more minutes, you can also stop at the 'Franziusstraße' station, which you can reach with both the 707 and 706 trains. If you want to come by car, there's parking spots (with a fee!) available right next to the building.</p></div></li><li><h3>13) TBDSG - Technology Immersion Course</h3><h4>Address: The Iron Yard - St. Petersburg & Tampa (260 1st Ave South, Suite 300, Saint Petersburg)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 01:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>The Iron Yard is excited to be hosting the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Data-Scientists-Tampa-Bay/">Tampa Bay Data Science Group</a></p> <p>This will be a continuation of Part 3 moving into the material for Part 4 covering:</p> <p>• TBD (Liam is currently outlining the class foci and will post here ASAP)</p> <p>• Gradient descent, activation functions, multilayer (but not deep) neural networks</p> <p>This is a 6-part course focusing on machine learning and neural networks. Each one of these meetings is meant to discuss each month's readings and exercises in these topic areas:</p> <p>1. simple perceptron <br/>2. complex functions, eg XOR, circles <br/>3. multilayer neural networks <br/>4. distributed processing, cuda <br/>5. "deep" learning <br/>6. final project tensor flow </p> <p>This is a collaborative learning process; there will be short presentations of code and methodology permitted, but this is not intended to be a teacher-led course. This is meant for everyone in attendance to learn a topic together throughout the 6 stages outlined above.</p> <p>This is a language agnostic activity in which each individual or team can pursue this task using a language of their choice. The survey shows that Python and R are by far the most used languages amongst survey participants. However, Java Script, SAS, and even Excel can be used to complete these tasks; so be as creative as you want to be!</p> <p>We'll be splitting the reading material into three types: recommended, suggested, and optional.  Yes, those all mean similar things.  None of the reading is required, and you can follow other sources.</p> <p>• Recommended readings define the core texts. </p> <p>• Suggested reading is extra, but useful. </p> <p>• Options reading is interesting or informative, but not core material. </p> <p>Here's the starter reading:</p> <p>Recommended</p> <p>S.

HQ (140 New Montgomery Street, Floor 9, San Francisco)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 01:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p><b>Continuous Integration with Android (Yelp)</b></p> <p><br/>As teams grow, having a mature continuous integration setup is crucial for code quality: you must be able to quickly and reliably verify that a given branch passes your tests. However, creating such a setup for Android can be painful or even impossible for smaller teams. At Yelp, our Android CI runs in the cloud and can be easily scaled as our needs grow. In this talk I’ll cover how we created our setup with Amazon EC2, Docker, and Firebase Test Lab.</p> <p><br/><i>About the speaker</i></p> <p>Coltin Caverhill is passionate about empowering other developers. As a member of Yelp's Android infrastructure team, he helps build a better future for testing, architecture, and collaboration. An avid gamer, he probably plays too much Factorio.</p> <p>



<b>Lightning fast Android builds with Gradle + Buck (Uber)</b></p> <p>Gradle is the typical build system of choice for android development, but it's performance tends to degrade as code bases become more complex. There exist alternate build systems like Buck (built by Facebook) that can build significantly faster than Gradle for Android, but they can be hard to migrate to and maintain. What if it is possible to have both the simplicity of expressing build logic in Gradle and also the fast build speeds of Buck? In this talk, Gautam will go over the open source OkBuck Gradle plugin and how it can help improve your android build speeds without having to learn and maintain a new build system.</p> <p><br/><i>About the speaker</i></p> <p>Gautam Korlam leads the Android Developer Experience Team at Uber. He is very passionate about tooling, infrastructure and build systems for building Android apps at scale.</p></div></li><li><h3>17) AngularJS Munich Meetup #16</h3><h4>Address: hybris GmbH (Nymphenburger Str. 86, München)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 01:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>At this Meetup we have the pleasure to have Manfred Steyer (Austria) as speaker:</p> <p>Step by Step: Improving Startup Performance with Lazy Loading in Angular (2)</p> <p>Angular (2) applications can lazily load modules to improve startup performance.

It’s designed to enable both beginners and those with some Java coding experience learn more, so by the end of the evening you will have moved your coding ability on and have a better understanding of the SOLID principles that are key to coding in Java. You’ll look at a non-SOLID version of a simple app and then we’ll collectively design a SOLID version that you’ll be able to code yourself. The advantages of SOLID principles will be clear by the end of the evening!</p> <p>This is a proper community event, with instruction from a senior member of the community and the chance to get to know fellow members of the community and support them in their learning, so the evening is also open to any experienced developers who may be interested in coming along and helping out with 1-2-1 coding. We hope to see you there!</p> <p>**Please make sure you bring your own laptop.**</p> <p>The evening will be led by <b>Omar Bashir </b>who graduated as an avionics systems engineer and transitioned to software engineering after his post graduate education. He has developed systems in diverse domains ranging from defence and telecommunications to logistics and finance. He has been programming in Java since its release in 1996.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>Doors open 6:15.

Ma jednak wiele mrocznych zakamarków, zwłaszcza jeśli mówimy o stosowaniu go w naprawdę dużych i skomplikowanych aplikacjach.</p> <p>TypeScript jest rozwiązaniem wielu problemów frapujących i frontendowców i backendowców pracujących z JavaScriptem! Będąc stosunkowo nowym graczem na rynku, wywalczył już sobie mocną pozycję pośród rywali - CoffeeScriptu oraz ES6. Angular2 wybrał TypeScript jako język źródłowy. Język ten posiada także bindingi do zdecydowanej większości istniejących bibliotek napisanych w natywnym JS. Dodatkowo, niektórzy developerzy twierdzą, że wybraliby TypeScript do każdego nowego projektu... mocne stwierdzenie.</p> <p>Podczas prelekcji omówię problemy natywnego JavaScriptu, z którymi zderzamy się w codziennej pracy, niekiedy z hukiem :) wskażę, które z nich rozwiązuje TypeScript. Wskażę też zagadnienia, które są poza jego "obszarem działania". Otrzymamy przekrojowe, obiektywne spojrzenie na język, pozwalające zdecydować, kiedy i dlaczego warto w niego iść.</p> <p><b> O prelegencie: </b></p> <p><b><a href="http://ducin.it/"> Tomasz Ducin</a> -</b> Zawodowo programuję od 7 lat, głównie z wykorzystaniem JavaScriptu, Pythona i Javy. Obecnie pracuję w firmie Cybercom Poland jako Senior Software Consultant. Interesuję się nowymi technologiami oraz nowoczesnym podejściem do tworzenia oprogramowania (TDD, CI, Scrum, etc). Słucham muzyki kiedy tylko się da, w wolnej chwili bywam w kinie lub teatrze, a weekendy lubię spędzać podróżując. Aha, uwielbiam (Monty) Pythona!</p> <p>

You are on your way to</p> <p>Microservices. Next you wrap it in a container and now it is an image that others can run. Simple. Now</p> <p>what? No service is an island. Your service needs to log information, needs to scale and load balance</p> <p>between its clones. Your service needs environment and metadata way outside its context. What about</p> <p>where the service will run? Who starts it? What monitors its health? What about antifragility? Updates?</p> <p>Networking? Oh my.</p> <p>Services live in clusters and clusters live in data centers. There are hybrid solutions that span data</p> <p>centers. Many concepts overlap with the features of cloud management. But don&amp;#39;t get too flustered</p> <p>since, fundamentally, services are managed by clusters. There are several approaches to cluster</p> <p>management such as Docker Swarm, Mesos with Marathon and Kubernetes.</p> <p>Minikube with Kubernetes is an approachable technique to set up a local cluster that is easy to</p> <p>understand and get started. Whether you have a simple service or a Web application with a set of</p> <p>services, you can develop much of it on Kubernetes with Minikube. We will run some practical</p> <p>examples.

We have various teams using one or more of Consul, Vault, Terraform, Nomad, Packer and Vagrant. </p> <p>Join us every month for our HashiStack series where we'll have Lieferando engineers as well as external speakers present their experiences and solutions using various HashiCorp tools. </p> <p>As we are Lieferando.de, you can expect some delicious Pizzas and fine beers. </p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>Takeaway.com and the HashiStack</b> by <b>Charles Akalugwu</b></p> <p><b><br/></b>As this is the inaugural Hashistack meetup hosted by Takeaway.com/Lieferando.de it is only appropriate to begin the series with an introduction to the company and how various HashiCorp tools are currently being used in various parts of our software stack.</p> <p>

<b>Terraform project best practices</b> by <b>David Mariassy</b></p> <p><br/>Terraform is a great new tool for managing infrastructure as code. We currently use it to provision our environments on AWS and love the fact that this tool will allow us to expand to hybrid deployments in the future whenever the need arises. There are however no standards or globally accepted best practices for Terraform project layout and deployment. This talk will outline some of our experiences as we embarked upon our journey with terraform as well as some patterns we have stuck with which works for us. </p> <p>


<b>Scheduling Heterogeneous Workloads using Nomad</b> by <b>Altay Aliyev</b> and <b>Charles Akalugwu</b></p> <p><b><br/></b>In the container scheduling and management space, Kubernetes and Mesos are all everyone talks about these days. While Kubernetes and mesos are really good options, their setup could be a bit complex for most use cases. If you already use consul in your environment then Nomad is a very good workload scheduling tool as it provides seamless integration and bootstrap using consul, has no external dependencies for its operation (e.g. no separate zookeeper to manage as is the case with mesos) and really just works! We'll give an introduction to Nomad and go into the various building blocks for Nomad services including Jobs, Task Groups and Tasks. We'll also talk about the various workload drivers suppported by Nomad as well as various deployment patterns supported by Nomad (blue-green and canaries).</p> <p><b>About the speakers</b></p> <p><b>Charles</b> is a founding member and Senior Software Engineer (Big Data) on the Data Infrastructure team at Takeaway.com where he works on the design, architecture and development of various cloud-based solutions for their data analytics platform.

Together, we’re going to address it in the new year by making it The Year of Building Apps, and I hope you’ll join us!</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/f/4/600_457019892.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>In programming, there’s a “forest vs. trees” problem. </b></p> <p>Even simple apps make use of a number of aspects of programming, any one of which you can study in depth. You can spend days learning about iOS’ user interface controls (there’s <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/ios-auto-layout-demystified-9780321967190">a whole book on Auto Layout,</a> and <a href="http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430233480">even a book just on table views!</a>), weeks covering the ins and outs of <a href="http://www.learncoredata.com/what-is-core-data/">Core Data,</a> and months on the various parts of <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/145318/spritekit-swift-3-tutorial-beginners">SpriteKit</a>, and still have lots of other topics to look over. </p> <p>The big challenge is taking those bits of knowledge — the <i>trees</i> — and applying and assembling them into an app — the <i>forest</i>. </p> <p><b>Tampa iOS Meetup is going to devote its 2017 sessions to walking you through the process of turning those trees into forests. </b>Each session will cover the building of a single app from start to finish. I’ll provide an overview of what we want the app to do, show you the iOS features, technologies, and libraries that you’ll need in order to build the app, and explain how you can bring them together to make the app a reality.</p> <p><br/>Whether you’re new to programming, or new to iOS programming, or have been learning iOS programming for a little while but are having trouble making the leap from doing tutorials to writing your own finished apps, if your new year’s resolution is to get an app in the App Store, you’ll want to come to the 2017 edition of Tampa iOS Meetup!</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/8/5/600_457013637.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>We’ll kick off the first meetup of the new year with a deceptively simple app: the tip calculator.</b></p> <p><br/>Why “dreaded”? That’s because at its heart, it’s a relatively simple app, which means that there are so many tip calculator apps, and so many of them are downright terrible. Our goal for the meetup will be to cover the many ways to make a tip calculator app that you wouldn't be ashamed to put in your developer portfolio.</p> <p>We’ll cover a number of topics in this session, including:</p> <p>• User interface controls</p> <p><br/>• Animations and other visual effects</p> <p><br/>• Rounding functions</p> <p><br/>• Useful hints on the Swift programming language</p> <p><br/>• The little things that make an app feel more solid and professional</p> <p><br/>This session will be suitable for newcomers to iOS development. If you’ve done some simple JavaScript development, you shouldn’t have any problem following along. If you’re new to programming in general, but have always wanted to make an iOS app, this is an ideal first project.</p> <p>You’ll come out of this session with a better understanding of the app development process, as well as source code and notes that you can use in writing your own apps.</p> <p>Come join us at the Tampa iOS Meetup! Learn about iOS programming, meet your peers in the Tampa Bay area, have some fun, and take the first step to creating your own apps and putting them in the App Store!</p></div></li><li><h3>26) Bots and Brains for Everybody</h3><h4>Address: The Network Hub (205 810 Quayside Dr, New Westminster)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 01:30:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>Interested in the Microsoft Bot Framework and Microsoft Cognitive Services?

During the stand-up limited feedback is welcome but we try to keep it short so folks can spend a majority of their time working on their project.</p> <p>After the stand-up we split up so folks can work on their project in whatever way is most productive. This is also an opportunity to give or solicit additional feedback or assistance about a project.

As a company, LeanKit have believed in Lean, Kanban, Agile &amp; DevOps since our founding. We've alway talked about how important these ideas are - in the community and inside our company.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean that doing those things in practice has been easy. We're a very fast growing startup in a very competitive market space. We've tripled in size in less than a year and nearly came apart at the seams at times.</p> <p>In fact, in the fall of 2015, our technology team were having a very hard time. We were out of sync with our sales &amp; marketing partners and facing a lot of internal conflict.</p> <p>But we came together as a team and worked hard to implement a well coordinated system of values, team structure, cadences, and standard practices. We're now in a much better place as a team and generating much better results for our company.</p> <p>There are no one-size-fits-all answers for companies. I can't promise that if you copy LeanKit you'll succeed. But we do think we have some interesting lessons learned to share and that you just might be able to pick up some ideas that you can take back to your company.</p> <p>Jon Terry is co-Chief Executive Officer of LeanKit. Before LeanKit, Jon held a number of senior IT positions with hospital-giant HCA and its logistics subsidiary, HealthTrust Purchasing Group. He was among those responsible for launching HCA’s adoption of Lean/Agile methods.</p> <p>

The intentional scope is wider than just discuss how to introduce Kanban technique; it's really about how we as Kanban/agile coaches can help the team injecting in them the capability to evolve in a continuous and sustainable way. Although we will use Kanban as a driver during the sessions, I hope all activities will help you also if you're working with other agile methodologies like Scrum.</p> <p>In the aim of this meetup is to share between all attendants the activities we use to kick start a team, what is our intention with each activity, how to facilitate it, tips and tricks discovered in our experience, etc.</p> <p>As I will love to go deep on the topic, I suggested to do a three in a row following meetups separated by one week so</p> <p>- we can focus each session in different domains of related activities, from "Creating the team" with activities like <i>Defining the Vision, writing Team Agreements</i>, etc. to "Understanding our process" with activities like <i>Discovering Upstream, Downstream and In-Procress, Creating the Board, Defining the policies</i>, etc...</p> <p>- we can explore and investigate deep in the topics presented between sessions.</p> <p>I will provide documentation and references of each activity presented, but I want also encourage you to make yours the sessions and actively participate sharing <i>"in this kind of situations I use to do this or that with the team, focusing on xyz, etc."  </i>The session is designed for experienced Kanban/agile coaches, scrum masters or any other role helping the teams, but if you're a member of a team with interest in knowing more on how to foster your incredible potential I hope it will help you also.</p> <p>At the end, I will love after this three sessions to create together an <b>AgileBcn's Field Guide for Kickstart Teams</b> with all this activities, alternative paths, etc. and publish so that can help all of us and others.</p> <p>For this set of sessions, the awesome coaches at Schibsted Laia Rosell and Manolo Lopez offer us to use Punto Vibbo as the venue. <b>Thanks Laia and Manolo!!

It's also the most expensive way. At Procurios, we've been learning for well over a decade. In this time we've worked on tons of projects for many customers. We've written millions of lines of code, and deleted just as many. We've made functional designs and we've made backlogs. And we'd like to share what we've learned with you.</p> <p>This non-technical talk will give a brief overview on how we do the right things, do the things right, and do things better. We will look at user stories, create persona's, construct a story map and gaze upon an actual real-life fail wall. Come learn from our mistakes, for cheap! </p> <p><b>Speaker: Pim Elshoff (<a href="https://twitter.com/pelshoff">@pelshoff</a>)</b><br/>I've been a developer-for-hire for over a decade and a professional developer any time soon now. With over half that time spent working with scrum at Procurios, the agile mindset has really clicked for me. Technology will always be a passion of mine, but with more experience my focus has shifted to people. I'm enthusiastic, I've got a loud mouth and I'm professionally stubborn.</p></div></li><li><h3>58) Hacky New Year!</h3><h4>Address: Disable address</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 02:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>A hacknight with a New Years twist!</p> <p>The New Year is a great time to take a moment to reflect on your accomplishments and make goals for going forward.

Sheridan Blvd, Suite 300, Westminster)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 02:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>PLEASE REGISTER ON <a href="https://www.davinciinstitute.com/colorado-events/#!event/2017/2/1/how-to-think-like-a-hacker">DAVINCIINSTITUTE.COM</a> FOR THIS EVENT AS THERE ARE ONLY 30 SEATS FOR EACH SESSION. </p> <p>Hacking starts with curiosity. Using tools to understand underlying systems, hackers conduct experiments to learn more about access control mechanisms, often writing programs to help them to explore. </p> <p><br/>Hacking becomes malicious when experimentation turns into unintended access, theft, and modifications. While security is a field unto itself, hacking has always been reserved as a word to describe the process of experimenting and learning with systems in today’s complex world. </p> <p>In this two-hour seminar, you will learn: </p> <p>• To inspect what lies under the hood of everyday web browsing. </p> <p>• Tricks to get access to structured information you might not have thought existed. </p> <p>• Techniques that are fundamental to screen scraping.</p> <p>

Understanding of the implications on both web security as well as the state of today’s information landscape. You’ll walk away more understanding about the data rich world we live in and hopefully an excited curiosity about what lies ahead for the world and the web. </p> <p>

All you need is to show up with your laptop and the Chrome web browser. </p> <p>

A instalação audiovisual ou cineinstalação compreende “outros cinemas”, outros espaços e temporalidades, com configurações heterogêneas e distintas do dispositivo cinematográfico tradicional. Nesses espaços, experimentamos sensações sinestésicas, táteis, gestuais, com o potencial de ativar outros sentidos corporais, e construir espaços relacionais, em que as outras pessoas presentes não são ignoradas, mas relacionadas entre si e, frequentemente, diretamente com a obra audiovisual. O próprio ato realizado pelo sujeito ao andar e penetrar uma instalação já se caracteriza por uma sensação háptica, do ato de andar e tocar os pés no chão. Cineinstalações são ambientes, atmosferas audiovisuais que envolvem os sujeitos presentes no espaço expositivo. Abordarei os espaços sensíveis, que permitem a interação, analisando 3 instalações: Socket Screen, de R. Rosalen e R. Marchetti, Meditation, de Minha Yang, Little Boxes, de Bego Santiago. Ao final pretendo realizar uma discussão sobre as possibilidades oferecidas pelo software processing em instalações audiovisuais.</p> <p><b>Pablo Villavicencio</b> Doutor em Comunicação e Semiótica pela PUC-SP, desde de 2015, sob orientação da profª. Dra. Lucia Leão. Título da pesquisa: Cineinstalações e o processo de criação no atravessamento dos espaços em ambientes audiovisuais e interativos: uma cartografia de poéticas experimentais. No período de doutorado foi bolsista integral da Capes durante 3 anos. É pesquisador do grupo Comunicação e Criação nas Mídias, coordenado pela profª Lucia Leão (registrado pelo CNPq). É mestre em Comunicação e Semiótica, tendo realizado a dissertação: A construção do tempo no diálogo entre cinema e vídeo, sob orientação da Profª. Dra. Lucrécia Ferrara (concluído em 2009). É especialista em Criação de Imagem e Som em Meios Eletrônicos, pelo centro universitário SENAC-SP (2006), é graduado em Publicidade e Propaganda pela Universidade de Franca (2001). Foi professor na universidade FMU/FIAM-SP, nos cursos de produção audiovisual e Rádio e Televisão, no período de 2009 até 2012, e no curso livre de audiovisual do SENAC-SP (2009). Realizou produções audiovisuais como editor de imagens e obras artísticas, sendo criador da instalação audiovisual In(Out)Side exibida no evento Zonas de Compensação, Instituto de Artes da Unesp, São Paulo (2015). Participou, como colaborador, da obra Dividing Lines, do grupo britânico Marshmallow Laser Feast, em exibição no SESI-SP, até 15 de novembro, de 2016. E obteve aprovação em edital do Sesi-SP para a realização de sua próxima instalação audiovisual denominada Amarelinha Digital para o ano de 2017, em parceria com Fabrício Masutti.</p></div></li><li><h3>69) Ruby Mini-Meet (Bozeman)</h3><h4>Address: Colombo's Pizza & Pasta (1003 W College St, Bozeman)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 02:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>This is a small meetup to talk about Ruby and Ruby related topics.

And we are happy that Alexander Thiel, CTO of StyleLounge is taking the lead for the first round. Looking forward to see you there!</p> <p><b>Topic Summary:</b></p> <p>A centralized data base and various services writing to it: What sometimes makes sense quickly becomes a bottle neck with growing traffic and functionality. Almost all scaling problems are caused by shared data access and its synchronization. For years focus has therefore shifted from vertical to horizontal performance. The time it takes a single function to complete is less relevant than the question whether it can be run concurrently. And that - in most applications - directly depends on how data is stored and accessed.</p> <p>In this talk I describe a simple migration strategy from monolith to reactive micro services. In addition I give references and insights their theoretical background.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Since his childhood and his first steps in programming he's fascinated by coding and its virtually infinite possibilities. He worked in various startups, learning about all their specific scalability and architecture issues. Since 2015 Alexander manages the great engineers of StyleLounge, the soon-to-be biggest fashion price comparison. As a CTO he's responsible for making the application fast, extensible, clean and above all scalable. If he's not discussing software architecture he's searching for talents for his team or digs into new technologies to keep the current stack (node.js, kubernetes, wercker, TypeScript, Babel, react+redux, redis, BigQuery, Elasticsearch) up-to-date.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>19.00: Food&amp;Drinks</p> <p>19.30: Intro - Christopher Denk</p> <p>19.40: Talk - Alexander Thiel</p> <p>20.40: Q&amp;A</p> <p>21.00: The End:)</p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p></div></li><li><h3>73) Lesson 1-12: Beginning</h3><h4>Address: Verones (419 W Commonwealth Ave, Fullerton)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 02:00:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>The starting point of the journey.

Brooks</h3><h4>Address: Sony Network Entertainment (6080 Center Drive, 10th Floor, Los Angeles)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 02:30:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p><i>The Design of Design: Essays from a Computer Scientist by Frederick P. Brooks</i></p> <p><b>Synopsis:</b></p> <p>Making Sense of Design</p> <p>Effective design is at the heart of everything from software development to engineering to architecture. But what do we really know about the design process? What leads to effective, elegant designs? The Design of Design addresses these questions.</p> <p>These new essays by Fred Brooks contain extraordinary insights for designers in every discipline. Brooks pinpoints constants inherent in all design projects and uncovers processes and patterns likely to lead to excellence. Drawing on conversations with dozens of exceptional designers, as well as his own experiences in several design domains, Brooks observes that bold design decisions lead to better outcomes.</p> <p>The author tracks the evolution of the design process, treats collaborative and distributed design, and illuminates what makes a truly great designer. He examines the nuts and bolts of design processes, including budget constraints of many kinds, aesthetics, design empiricism, and tools, and grounds this discussion in his own real-world examples—case studies ranging from home construction to IBM's Operating System/360. Throughout, Brooks reveals keys to success that every designer, design project manager, and design researcher should know.</p></div></li><li><h3>77) Equibit ICO Launch Party</h3><h4>Address: The Loft at 600 F (600 F Street NW, Washington, DC 20004, Washington)</h4><h4>Date: 2017-02-01 02:30:00</h4><h4>Description:</h4><div><p>YOU MUST REGISTER FOR A TICKET ON EVENTBRITE.

Attendees will enjoy hors-d’oeuvres, drinks and get to meet the executives and senior management. CEO Chris Horlacher will also be giving a talk about the promise of Equibit and its potential impact on the capital markets industry.</p> <p>EDC is building Equibit, the world's first peer-to-peer equity marketplace and a complete platform for issuers to manage their investor relations without the need for depositories and transfer agents. Equibit allows issuers to use cryptocurrency tokens, called 'equibits', to authorize and disseminate their shares. It also includes a secure, P2P communications system allowing for private messages and polls to be instantly sent to individuals and groups on the network. A public component of the communications system allows for the announcement of bid/ask type messages, in the same vein as an open outcry trading pit but on a global scale. Investors can designate and revoke proxy rights with a simple click of their mouse. Equibit also includes trading passports, an ingenious way of handling the KYC issues currently faced by blockchain technology.

Based on a sophisticated understanding of the body’s mechanics, this practice dispels inertia in the body’s energy and brings ease to the whole system. </p> <p><br/><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/d/a/4/600_457271684.jpeg" /></p> <p>


Within the human system, the energy flows along 72,000 pathways called nadis. At the joints, the nadis meet and form nodes, making the joints storehouses of energy. Upa Yoga activates this energy and also lubricates the joints, creating an instant sense of alertness and liveliness.</p> <p>Upa Yoga essentially means “sub-yoga” or “pre-yoga”. Because of its many immediate and evident benefits, the word is commonly used to denote “usefulness.”</p> <p><b>Upa Yoga has numerous benefits:</b></p> <p>1.

(Julian Szulc)<br/>W codziennej pracy borykamy się z błędami w kodzie, z awariami sprzętu, z problemami bezpieczeństwa, czasem ze zwykłym ludzkim błędem. Tych problemów nie wyeliminujemy, chociaż byśmy pisali najlepszy kod na świecie, mieli najbardziej rygorystyczne procedury bezpieczeństwa i sprzęt z najwyższej półki od najlepszych dostawców. Ważne jest jednak, abyśmy potrafili na nie szybko zareagować w przypadku sytuacji kryzysowej. A jak się do tego mają wspomniane w tytule pożary lasów? Odpowiedź znajdziecie oglądając prezentację.</p> <p>2. Buckminster Fuller, czyli o drzemiącym potencjale w skali mikro (Szymon Biliński)<br/>Buckminster Fuller był teoretykiem systemów. Jego prace o tym jak zmieniać organizację i pracę nad projektem, używając minimalnego potencjału środków organizacji zamiast masywnych sił zewnętrznych, to pozycja obowiązkowa dla każdego PMa. W Polsce postać mało znana. W prezentacji pokażę na przykładach jak zasady autora "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" znalazły zastosowanie w zarządzaniu zmianą i nie tylko.</p> <p>3. Uczenie maszynowe w praktyce (Łukasz Rączkowski)<br/>Mimo że algorytmy związane z AI i uczeniem maszynowym istnieją już od kilkudziesięciu lat, to dopiero stosunkowo niedawno tematyka ta nabrała znaczenia w biznesie. Autonomiczne samochody, wirtualni asystenci czy internetowe przychodnie lekarskie - wszystkie te produkty wykorzystują technologie z tej dziedziny. W ramach niniejszej prezentacji omówione zostaną praktyczne aspekty uczenia maszynowego wraz z kilkoma ciekawymi zastosowaniami.</p> <p>PRELEGENCI</p> <p>Julian Szulc - Site Reliability Engineer odpowiedzialny za bezpieczeństwo techniczne platformy Allegro. W Allegro pracuje od 2011 roku. Programista z ponad dziesięcioletnim doświadczeniem w budowaniu złożonych systemów informatycznych z wykorzystaniem języków C/C++, Python, PHP i Ruby.
